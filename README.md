# Automated Configuration and Compilation of a Gentoo System

Configuring and compiling the Gentoo operating system is a time-consuming and tedious task, typically requiring a week of free time to manually set up due to the extensive customization options available.

To address this, we have developed a program that allows users to customize their Gentoo system through a graphical interface or by directly modifying the configuration file. The program automatically compiles the Gentoo operating system on a kernel based on the generated configuration file. As a result, users only need to select their desired parameters, initiate the compilation process, and enjoy a long coffee break.

This project aims to simplify and automate the configuration and compilation process of Gentoo, providing users with a streamlined method for tailoring their system to their preferences.
